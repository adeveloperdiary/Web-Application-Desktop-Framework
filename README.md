# Web Application Desktop Framework

In the advent of Web 2.0 era I was on steroids to fully utilize the newer tools and technologies. Adobe Flex was the magical tool which helped me to materialize my vision. Many enterprise applications were still using vanila javascripts and porlets for rendering the UI. 

I created an opensource framework using Action Script 3 and MXML which will enable full windows capabilities in the browser, something like having Visual Basic in the browser. However all the complexities are embeded in the framework so that developer can just extend the library and the features will be automatically added. I pretty much replicated how windows works internally, like every application will have an entry in task manager, the windows can be minimized or maximized, interdependencies between parent and child windows etc.

I initially uploaded the demo ( a much richer version that whats given below ) and there were more than million views in just a week. In 2008 it still was a big thing as I never had any online presence. I started receiving emails from around the globe on sharing the code. 

Since adobe is sunsetting Flash by end of 2020, I have decided to provide my tribute by sharing some of the early concepts and code. 

It's my pleasure to say that this framework was reviewed and approved by [Yakov Fain](https://yakovfain.com/) (Java Champion) to be used across exterprise. There are applications still up and running using this framework in production system ( more than 12 years now) without any issues.

Here is a very early demo of the framework.
